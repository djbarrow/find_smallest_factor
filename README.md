Finds the smallest factor in a composite number might help crack rsa the bank encryption scheme
My program fundamental found a way to get the smallest factor of a number
However I need more memory than atoms in the universe to complete the job for 2048 bit rsa it's limited at the moment to 2^31 on an 8GB ram machine.
The result may be linked to fermats primality test to unzip the source
I don't think I will crack rsa but it's a new approach and might lead to something with a better mathematician than me.

I always believed rsa could be cracked on a zx spectrum
Seeing as the did a differential question answer differential equation of the entire knowledge of google with sentence and paragraph attention in chatgpt rsa now looks like low hanging fruit.
Now I might be closer.


To  protect banks I advise the following scheme
