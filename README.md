THIS CODE BREAKS AT FINDING SMALLEST FACTOR OF 35 IT DOESN'T WORK IT JUST PAST A FEW TESTS AND I THOUGHT IT DID
# find_smallest_factor
In my opinion RSA is cracked

Finds the smallest factor in a composite number might help crack rsa the bank encryption scheme
My program fundamental found a way to get the smallest factor of a number
However I need more memory than atoms in the universe to complete the job for 2048 bit rsa it's limited at the moment to 2^31 on an 8GB ram machine.
The result may be linked to fermats primality test to unzip the source
I don't think I will crack rsa but it's a new approach and might lead to something with a better mathematician than me.

I always believed rsa could be cracked on a zx spectrum
Seeing as the did a differential question answer differential equation of the entire knowledge of google with sentence and paragraph attention in chatgpt rsa now looks like low hanging fruit.
Now I might be closer.


To  protect banks I advise the following scheme 
Multiple encryption - Wikipedia
lease read all of this I tried to crack rsa for one man year by night to pull pretty women with my reputation. These are my attempts to crack RSA. RSA the encryption algorithm that secures all the Worlds Banks for since 1975 is based on a mathematical problem which has stumped the best Mathematicians in the World since the Stone Age, the factoring of large numbers.

I believe this is cracked the prize challenge numbers on the rsa website are no longer there. Banks please use this technique, I can't crack this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_encryption but telling me a problem a 10 year old can understand says to me its wide open to a smartypants. Dave Flannnerys daughter Sarah my maths teacher won a young scientist or Ireland Prize for her prime encryption technique a hacker broke it in 6 months.

I'm aware of a back dooor in https security library in chrome GnuTLS findable by any fool willing to read or ask google.

If they can do a question answer differential equation on the entire of google called chatgpt what hope has 2048 bit factorisation to a hacker.

The nature of the hacker is the bigger the puzzle the more likely it will be cracked hackers love puzzles. I've a buddy Segher who learned russian to read a number theory book.
